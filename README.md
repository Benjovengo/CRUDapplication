# React-Node Challenge<br><sup>_CRUD Application to manage purchases and products_</sup>

Welcome to the challenge project repository! Here you will find the implementation of a comprehensive system that manages purchases and products. The project consists of the development of both front-end and back-end using React.js Node.js components respectively, as well as integration with a MySQL database.

The system includes two fundamental features: a CRUD for products and a CRUD for purchases. Both functionalities are built on top of REST endpoints, which provide a robust and flexible API for managing and retrieving data.

We hope you find this project informative and useful, and we look forward to any feedback or contributions you may have.
